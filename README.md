# Churn-Prediction-using-ANN
This project aims at predicting whether the customer will churn or not. 

# About Dataset

The datset consists of 14 attributes and 10000 rows.(RowNumber,CustomerId,Surname,CreditScore,Geography,Gender,Age,Tenure,Balance,NumOfProducts,HasCrCard,IsActiveMember,EstimatedSalary,Exited) where Exited is the target column.

# ANN Implementation

->Data preprocessing like standardization and one hot encoding is done.

->Artificial neural network is used with two hidden layers and one output layer. Adam is used as the optimiser with learning rate=0.01 and sparse cross entropy to calculate the loss function. RELU and softmax are used as the activation function in the hidden and output layers. Validation accuracy of 0.860 was achieved.
